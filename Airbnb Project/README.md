## Objective

Work in progress.

## Data Pipeline

Data Warehouse (Snowflake) -> Transformation (dbt) -> Dashboard (Prefect)

Steps:
1. Ingest data into Snowflake.
2. Perform transformation of data in dbt in which the cleansed models are materialised in Snowflake
3.

**DAG**

## Setup virtual environment and dbt

Create a virtual environment by running the commands below:
```bash
# Create the virtual environment. Ensure that you have "cd" in the desired project's folder.
python3 -m venv venv # venv is the name of the virtual environment

# Activate the newly created virtual environment "venv"
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dbt-snowflake library:
```bash
pip3 install dbt-snowflake
dbt # Run dbt to confirm that dbt is installed and working. You'll see a list of help guides.
```

Create a dbt project
```bash
dbt init dbtlearn # dbtlearn is the project name

type: snowflake
account: https://<take this value>.snowflakecomputing.com
user: <username in Snowflake>
password: <password in Snowflake>
role: <role in Snowflake>
warehouse: <warehouse in Snowflake> # Uppercase/lowercase-sensitive
database: <database in Snowflake> # Uppercase/lowercase-sensitive
schema: <schema in Snowflake> # Uppercase/lowercase-sensitive

# To check that the project has all the files it needs
dbt debug # Ensure it says "All checks passed!"
```

## Create dbt Models

Before we start, the models or SQL files in dbt are separated into layers:

**1) Staging Models (Src)**
- Stored in `models/s
- Purpose: Ingest raw or lightly cleansed data from source (ie. Snowflake).
- Work done on data: Minimal (change column name) or no transformation.

**2) Dimension Models (Dim)**
- Purpose: Models contain descriptive information about data ie. products, location, time.
- Typically denormalized.
- Work done on data: Filtering, grouping, aggregating, type casting, joins, defining categories (using CASE statement).

**3) Fact Models (Fct)**
- Purpose: Models store quantitative and analytical data ie. events, transactions, orders.
- Contain measures like sales, revenue, quantity, etc to perform analytics or metrics calculations.
- Work done on data: Aggregations, calculations

‚ÄºÔ∏è Do not end the models (.sql) with `;` in dbt. It'll throw an error. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

## 1) Create Staging Models

**`src_listings.sql`**

Create `src_listings` model (.sql) in `models/src` folder with the following SELECT statement. Click [here](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/why-the-fishtown-sql-style-guide-uses-so-many-ctes/1091) to understand why we are "importing" the upstream data in CTEs.

```sql
-- File path: models/src/src_listings.sql
WITH raw_listings AS (
	SELECT *
	FROM AIRBNB.RAW.RAW_LISTINGS
)

SELECT 
  id AS listing_id,
  name AS listing_name,
  listing_url,
  room_type,
  minimum_nights,
  host_id,
  price AS price_str,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM 
  raw_listings
```

To materialise models in dbt and Snowflake, run `dbt run` or, to run a specific model `dbt run -m src_listings` in termimal.

<img width="825" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-27 at 11 19 35 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/221465370-43ca1830-945c-4789-88ca-b8d48ed7a945.png">

Do the same with `src_reviews` and `src_hosts` models.

**`src_reviews.sql`**

```sql
-- File path: models/src/src_reviews.sql
WITH raw_reviews AS (
	SELECT *
	FROM AIRBNB.RAW.RAW_REVIEWS
)

SELECT
	listing_id,
	date AS review_date,
	reviewer_name,
	comments AS review_text,
	sentiment AS review_sentiment
FROM raw_reviews
```

**`src_hosts.sql`**

```sql
-- File path: models/src/src_hosts.sql
WITH raw_hosts AS (
	SELECT *
	FROM AIRBNB.RAW.RAW_HOSTS
)

SELECT
	id AS host_id,
	name AS host_name,
	is_superhost,
	created_at,
	updated_at
FROM raw_hosts
```

Then, run `dbt run` to materialise the new models in dbt and Snowflake.
<img width="828" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/221467527-563cc613-86a5-46d7-a3c8-77b8b1c76524.png">

In Snowflake, the **DEV** folder is created to contain all the dbt materialisations. All the newly created models are contained in the **Views** folder.
<img width="1438" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-27 at 11 42 14 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/221467811-70144a38-8407-4d8f-b8d5-a0aa158444ac.png">

## 2) Create Dim Models

Create a `models/dim` folder to put in the dim models, which are the cleansed models from `src`, or staging layer. This keeps all the models well-organized. 

**`dim_listings_cleansed.sql`**

```sql
-- File path: models/dim/dim_listings_cleansed.sql
WITH src_listings AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ref("src_listings")}}
)

SELECT
    listing_id,
    listing_name,
    room_type,
    CASE
        WHEN minimum_nights = 0 THEN 1
        ELSE minimum_nights 
    END AS minimum_nights, -- ensure that the minimum stay is 1 night
    host_id, 
    LTRIM(price_str,'$')::NUMBER(10,2) AS price_per_night, -- remove "$" and cast into number with 2 decimals
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM src_listings
```

**`dim_hosts_cleansed.sql`**

```sql
-- File path: models/dim/dim_hosts_cleansed.sql
WITH src_hosts AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ref("src_hosts")}}
)

SELECT
    host_id,
    NVL(host_name,'Anonymous') AS host_name,
    is_superhost,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM src_hosts
```

This is how the folder structure should look like now:
<img width="286" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 3 06 43 PM" src="https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/assets/81607668/a1ff5342-e38f-41c0-8aa1-9b65f09b49a0">

## 3) Create Fct Models

**`fct_reviews.sql`**

To update and append new data to the existing `fct_reviews` model in an incremental fashion. Click [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#using-incremental-materializations) for the official dbt documentation on the incremental model.

```sql
-- File path: models/fct/fct_reviews.sql

-- Macro configuration to materialise model incrementally: 
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        on_schema_changes='fail'
    )
}}


WITH src_reviews AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ref("src_reviews")}}
)

SELECT *
FROM src_reviews
WHERE review_text IS NOT NULL
{% if is_incremental() %}
  -- This filter will only be applied on an incremental run.
  -- If there are rows with review_date greater than the most recent review_date in this model, select row and add into {{ this }} model.
  -- This condition ensures that only new or updated records since the last dbt run are included.
  AND review_date > (select MAX(review_date) FROM {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

<img width="840" alt="image" src="https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/assets/81607668/8be2fed5-23e4-4a68-b928-8c705616f5e8">

**`dim_listings_w_hosts.sql`**

```sql
-- File path: models/fct/fct_reviews.sql

WITH 

listings AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ ref("dim_listings_cleansed")}}
),

hosts AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ ref("dim_hosts_cleansed")}}
)

SELECT
    l.listing_id,
    l.listing_name,
    l.room_type,
    l.minimum_nights,
    l.price_per_night,
    l.host_id,
    h.host_name,
    h.is_superhost AS host_is_superhost,
    l.created_at,
    GREATEST(l.updated_at, h.updated_at) AS updated_at -- Keep the most recent updated date

FROM listings AS l
LEFT JOIN hosts AS h
    ON l.host_id = h.host_id
```

Now that all the models are created, we changed the materialisation of source models (ie. `src_hosts`, `src_listings`, and `src_reviews`) to ephemeral in `dbt_project.yml` so that it will be materialised as a CTE and will not appear in the **Dev** folder in Snowflake. 
<img width="1436" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 4 15 05 PM" src="https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/assets/81607668/55d78ff3-ac33-43aa-aa45-b24ef619dbaf">

dbt does not remove them as views, so we'll need to drop them in Snowflake.
<img width="1436" alt="image" src="https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/assets/81607668/8e5a69a1-5d64-47af-a125-6e31b26ca188">

4) Uploading CSV from S3

Run the command to copy the `seed_full_moon_dates.csv` file from S3 to the project's seed folder.

```bash
curl https://dbtlearn.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/seed_full_moon_dates.csv -o seeds/seed_full_moon_dates.csv
```

Then, run `dbt seed` to populate the CSV as a Table in Snowflake.

The `seed_full_moon_dates.csv` is updated in Snowflake.
<img width="1436" alt="image" src="https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/assets/81607668/2ad8b9de-a4c8-4a64-9bb1-ba6f25efff08">

### Compiled Models in Target

To view the compiled models (.sql) in dbt, go to `target/compiled/dbtlearn/models/[dim/fct/src].sql`.

Here's a sample of a compiled model (`dim_hosts_cleansed.sql`):
<img width="1436" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 4 21 48 PM" src="https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/assets/81607668/28524691-7fe5-4007-b677-9ff327455be8">

Can copy and run in Snowflake for debugging purposes.

***

### Final Materialisation for Models

Once all the models have been cleansed, now we'll change the materialisation in dbt_project.yml.
```yml
models:
  dbtlearn2:
    +materialized: view # Applied to all models except dim and src
    dim: 
      +materialized: table # Applied to dim
    src:
      +materialized: ephemeral # Applied to src
```

Run `dbt run` and refresh Snowflake for the changes to take place.

<img width="885" alt="image" src="https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/assets/81607668/e209389f-24db-4814-a061-a3e83a2d83d1">

You will not see src models in Snowflake as they are ephemeral materialisations and will not appear in Snowflake.
<img width="1436" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 5 45 46 PM" src="https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/assets/81607668/67b75619-40ac-4393-9592-6aa67cd49988">

### Snapshots

Snapshots are created using a snapshot block with configs onto a SELECT statement.

Here's an example of how a snapshot looks like:

<img width="611" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/221782071-35e66952-caa2-4fa1-a678-2d4ea322626f.png">

Snapshot automatically includes the columns `dbt_scd_id`, `dbt_updated_at`, `dbt_valid_from` and `dbt_valid_to`. In the first snapshot, `dbt_valid_to` is `null` because this column contains date of the next most recent changes or snapshot. 

<img width="1136" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/221782810-89766268-0725-4b95-a121-974423892382.png">

Let's say I make a change in id=3176 and ran `dbt snapshot` again. You'll see that `dbt_valid_to` contains the current timestamped and the next line represents id 3176 as well with a null `dbt_valid_to`.

<img width="833" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/221783996-15275e80-e3ac-4fb8-84c1-2882b061f585.png">

***

### Tests

Creating singular tests

```sql
-- tests/dim_listings_minimum_nights.sql
SELECT * 
FROM {{ref ('dim_listings_cleansed')}}
WHERE minimum_nights < 1
LIMIT 10
```

Instead of creating query tests, I can also convert them into custom generic test like below so that I can reuse for other purposes.

```sql
-- macro/positive_value.sql
-- A singular test that fails when column_name is less than 1

{% test positive_value(model, column_name) %}

    SELECT * FROM {{ model }}
    WHERE {{ column_name }} < 1

{% endtest %}
```

To apply them, I add the `positive_value` macro to the `schema.yml` referencing the `minimum_nights` field.

### dbt Packages

I'm using a `dbt utils`[doc](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/) packages specifically the `generate_source_key`[doc](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/1.0.0/#generate_surrogate_key-source) which generates a unique ID based on the specified column IDs.

<img width="893" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/222340554-760c7e0d-2cbc-499e-a59c-e123ca7fcfb6.png">


I created a `packages.yml` file with the following package and ran `dbt deps` to install the package.

```yml
-- packages.yml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.0.0
```

<img width="733" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/222339997-61556323-9fdc-434e-a5b1-11819dc66442.png">

Then, I use this function in the `fct_reviews.sql` where I created a unique ID as the `review_id` based on the `listing_id`, `review_date`, `reviewer_name`, and `review_text` fields. 

<img width="1022" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/222340279-0d2a97a2-136b-4379-bc42-cb6fdc741ad7.png">

As `fct_reviews.sql` is an incremental, I ran the `dbt run --full-refresh --select fct_reviews` instead of `dbt run` because

### Documentation

I ran `dbt docs serve` to open into website.
