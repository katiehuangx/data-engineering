1. Data is extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/dog-adoption) and saved locally.
2. The [dog_adoption.ipynb script](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/blob/main/Dog%20Adoption/dog_adoption.ipynb), initiates a connection to PostgreSQL and creates the database with auto-commit being run. 
3. Tables are created with the appropriate columns and data types. 
4. Data is fed into the newly created tables.
