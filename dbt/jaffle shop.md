## Refactoring SQL for Modularity [Tutorial]

### 1. Migrating Code

In the dbt project, under the models folder, I create a subfolder called `legacy`. Within the `legacy` folder, I create a file called `customer_orders.sql` with the following query provided by the tutorial.

_Note: Model and YAML files built for this tutorial are affixed with `_tt`._

```sql
-- customer_orders.sql
WITH paid_orders as (select Orders.ID as order_id,
        Orders.USER_ID    as customer_id,
        Orders.ORDER_DATE AS order_placed_at,
            Orders.STATUS AS order_status,
        p.total_amount_paid,
        p.payment_finalized_date,
        C.FIRST_NAME    as customer_first_name,
            C.LAST_NAME as customer_last_name
    FROM raw.jaffle_shop.orders as Orders
    left join (select ORDERID as order_id, max(CREATED) as payment_finalized_date, sum(AMOUNT) / 100.0 as total_amount_paid
from raw.stripe.payment
where STATUS <> 'fail'
group by 1) p ON orders.ID = p.order_id
left join raw.jaffle_shop.customers C on orders.USER_ID = C.ID ),

customer_orders 
    as (select C.ID as customer_id
        , min(ORDER_DATE) as first_order_date
        , max(ORDER_DATE) as most_recent_order_date
        , count(ORDERS.ID) AS number_of_orders
    from raw.jaffle_shop.customers C 
    left join raw.jaffle_shop.orders as Orders
    on orders.USER_ID = C.ID 
    group by 1)

select
    p.*,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY p.order_id) as transaction_seq,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY p.order_id) as customer_sales_seq,
    CASE WHEN c.first_order_date = p.order_placed_at
    THEN 'new'
    ELSE 'return' END as nvsr,
    x.clv_bad as customer_lifetime_value,
    c.first_order_date as fdos
    FROM paid_orders p
    left join customer_orders as c USING (customer_id)
    LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    (
            select
            p.order_id,
            sum(t2.total_amount_paid) as clv_bad
        from paid_orders p
        left join paid_orders t2 on p.customer_id = t2.customer_id and p.order_id >= t2.order_id
        group by 1
        order by p.order_id
    ) x on x.order_id = p.order_id
    ORDER BY order_id
```

Under the models folder, create a subfolder called marts. Within the marts folder, create a file called `fct_customer_orders_tt.sql` with the following query.

```sql
-- fct_customer_orders_tt.sql
WITH paid_orders as (select Orders.ID as order_id,
        Orders.USER_ID    as customer_id,
        Orders.ORDER_DATE AS order_placed_at,
            Orders.STATUS AS order_status,
        p.total_amount_paid,
        p.payment_finalized_date,
        C.FIRST_NAME    as customer_first_name,
            C.LAST_NAME as customer_last_name
    FROM raw.jaffle_shop.orders as Orders
    left join (select ORDERID as order_id, max(CREATED) as payment_finalized_date, sum(AMOUNT) / 100.0 as total_amount_paid
from raw.stripe.payment
where STATUS <> 'fail'
group by 1) p ON orders.ID = p.order_id
left join raw.jaffle_shop.customers C on orders.USER_ID = C.ID ),

customer_orders 
    as (select C.ID as customer_id
        , min(ORDER_DATE) as first_order_date
        , max(ORDER_DATE) as most_recent_order_date
        , count(ORDERS.ID) AS number_of_orders
    from raw.jaffle_shop.customers C 
    left join raw.jaffle_shop.orders as Orders
    on orders.USER_ID = C.ID 
    group by 1)

select
    p.*,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY p.order_id) as transaction_seq,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY p.order_id) as customer_sales_seq,
    CASE WHEN c.first_order_date = p.order_placed_at
    THEN 'new'
    ELSE 'return' END as nvsr,
    x.clv_bad as customer_lifetime_value,
    c.first_order_date as fdos
    FROM paid_orders p
    left join customer_orders as c USING (customer_id)
    LEFT OUTER JOIN 
    (
            select
            p.order_id,
            sum(t2.total_amount_paid) as clv_bad
        from paid_orders p
        left join paid_orders t2 on p.customer_id = t2.customer_id and p.order_id >= t2.order_id
        group by 1
        order by p.order_id
    ) x on x.order_id = p.order_id
    ORDER BY order_id
```

Conduct a `dbt run -m fct_customer_orders_tt` to ensure the model is built in the BigQuery warehouse under `dbt_khuang > fct_customer_orders_tt` (i.e, `dbt_khuang.fct_customer_orders_tt`).

In the root folder, I create a file `packages.yml` to utilise the audit helper. I obtained the updated package [here](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/audit_helper/latest/).

```yml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/audit_helper
    version: 0.7.0
```

Hit the Preview button. The 1 line output is showing 100% match between the two files, because they are exactly the same.

### 2. Implementing Sources and Choosing a Refactoring Strategy

Create a subfolder under models folder called staging.

Under your models > staging folder, create two subfolders - one for each source schema that the original query pulls from. These subfolders are stripe and jaffle_shop.

Then, I create a file under models > staging > jaffle_shop called `src_jaffle_shop.yml`. The other configurations in the file were from the dbt Fundamentals course's project.

<img width="1438" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/218363805-048ec489-ba24-4c84-83bc-315b6dd5e878.png">

Create a file under models > staging > stripe called `src_stripe.yml`. 

<img width="1438" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/218363845-9c333a00-dbbd-4157-a34f-cb16ae9246b6.png">

Conduct a `dbt run -m fct_customer_orders` to ensure that your sources are configured properly and your model rebuilds in the warehouse.

Run `dbt docs generate` and inspect the DAG.

### 3. Cosmetic Cleanups and CTE Groupings

**Import CTEs at the top**

1. Refactor the cosmetics of the `fct_customer_orders.sql` model using the following guidelines:

- Add whitespacing
- No lines over 80 characters
- Lowercase keywords

2. Refactor the code to follow this structure:

```sql
-- WITH statement
-- Import CTEs
-- Logical CTEs
-- Final CTE
-- Simple Select Statement
```

Steps to achieve this:
a. Add a WITH statement to the top of the `fct_customer_orders` model
b. Add import CTEs after the WITH statement for each source table used in the query
c. Ensure subsequent FROM statements reference the named CTEs instead of {{ source() }}.

### Centralizing Logic and Splitting Up Models

**a. Staging Models**

1. Create new staging files for each source:
- `stg_jaffle_shop__customers.sql` & `stg_jaffle_shop__orders.sql` under `models > staging > jaffle_shop`
- `stg_stripe__payments.sql` under `models > staging > stripe`

2. Make necessary changes in each file:
- Change `id` fields to `<object>_id`
- Make potentially clashing fields more specific, i.e. `status` becomes `order_status`
- Apply rounding or simple transformations, i.e. change `amount` to `round(amount / 100.0, 2) as payment_amount`
    
```sql
-- models/staging/jaffle_shop/stg_jaffle_shop_customers.sql
with 

source as (
    
    select * from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }}
    
),
    
transformed as (

    select 

        id as customer_id,
        last_name as surname,
        first_name as givenname,
        first_name || ' ' || last_name as full_name
    
    from source

)

select * from transformed
```

```sql
-- models/staging/jaffle_shop/stg_jaffle_shop_orders.sql
with

source as (
    
    select * from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}

),

transformed as (
    select
        id as order_id,
        user_id as customer_id,
        status as order_status,
        order_date as order_placed_at,

        case
            when status not in ('returned', 'return_pending') 
            then order_date
        end as valid_order_date,
        
        row_number() over (
            partition by user_id 
            order by order_date, id
        ) as user_order_seq

    from source
)

select * from transformed
```

```sql
-- models/staging/jaffle_shop/stg_payments.sql
with 

source as (

    select * from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'payments') }}

),

transformed as (
    select 
        id as payment_id,
        orderid as order_id,
        created as payment_created_at,
        status as payment_status,
        round(amount/100.0, 2) as payment_amount

    from source

)

select * from transformed
```

1. Update references in `fct_customer_orders.sql` to point to the new staging models using the `{{ ref('<your_model>') }}` function.

2. Change any column reference from the original column names to the new column names, for example, change id to customer_id.

**b. Intermediate Models / Additional CTEs**

1. Create a new intermediate model to store reusable logic.

2. Add a new file `int_orders_tt.sql` under the `marts/intermediate` folder.

```sql
-- models/marts/intermediate/int_orders_tt.sql
with

customers as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop_customers') }}

),

orders as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop_orders') }}

),

payments as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop_payments') }}

),

completed_payments as (

    select 
        
        order_id, 
        max(payment_created_at) as payment_finalized_date, 
        sum(payment_amount) as total_amount_paid
        
    from payments

    where payment_status <> 'fail'
    group by 1

),

paid_orders as (
    
    select 

        orders.order_id,
        orders.customer_id,
        orders.order_placed_at,
        orders.order_status,
        completed_payments.total_amount_paid,
        completed_payments.payment_finalized_date,
        customers.givenname,
        customers.surname
    
    from orders
    left join completed_payments
    on orders.order_id = completed_payments.order_id

    left join customers
    on orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id 
        
)

select * from paid_orders
```

4. Remove helper comments we added for the course (i.e. -- Import CTEs)

**c. Final Model**

In the final file, be more explicit with ordering of window function subclause. This fixes a future potential bug where if there are multiple orders placed on the same day for one customer ID, this would cause indeterminate ordering.

```sql
-- models/core/fct_customer_orders_tt
with

customers as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_jaffle_shop_customers') }}

),

paid_orders as (
    
    select * from {{ ref('int_orders_tt') }}
        
),

final as (

select
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_placed_at,
    order_status,
    total_amount_paid,
    payment_finalized_date,
    givenname,
    surname,

    -- sales transaction sequence
    row_number() over (
        order by order_id) as transaction_seq,

    -- customer sales sequence
    row_number() over (
        partition by customer_id 
        order by order_id) as customer_sales_seq,

    -- new vs returning customers
    case when (
        rank() over (
        partition by customer_id
        order by order_placed_at, order_id)
    ) = 1
    then 'new'
    else 'return' 
    end as nvsr,

    -- customer lifetime value
    sum(total_amount_paid) over (
        partition by customer_id
        order by order_placed_at
    ) as customer_lifetime_value,

    -- first day of sales
    first_value(order_placed_at) over (
        partition by customer_id
        order by order_placed_at
    ) as fdos
        
from paid_orders

)

-- Simple Select Statement

select * from final
```
