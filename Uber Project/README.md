# ðŸš— Uber Data Engineering Project

## Objective

In this project, I designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline that consists of several stages:
1. Extracted data from NYC Trip Record Data website and loaded it into Google Cloud Storage for further processing.
2. Transformed the data using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Modeled the data using fact and dimensional data modeling concepts.
4. Orchestrated the data pipeline on Mage and loaded the transformed data into Google BigQuery.
5. Developed a dashboard on Looker Studio.

## Technologies

To implement this data pipeline, I leveraged a range of technologies, including:
- Extraction and transformation - Python, Jupyter Notebook, Google BigQuery
- Storage - Google Storage
- Orchestration - [Mage](https://www.mage.ai)
- Dashboard - [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com)

## Dataset Used

TLC Trip Record Data Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
