# ðŸš— Uber Data Engineering Project

## Objective

In this project, I designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline that consists of several stages:
1. Extracted data from NYC Trip Record Data website and loaded it into **Google Cloud Storage** for further processing.
2. Transformed the data using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Modeled the data using fact and dimensional data modeling concepts.
4. Orchestrated the data pipeline on **Mage** and loaded the transformed data into **Google BigQuery**.
5. Developed a dashboard on **Looker Studio**.

## Technologies

To implement this data pipeline, I leveraged a range of technologies, including:
- Programming language: Python, SQL
- Extraction and transformation: Jupyter Notebook, Google BigQuery
- Storage: Google Storage
- Orchestration: [Mage](https://www.mage.ai)
- Dashboard: [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com)

## Dataset Used

TLC Trip Record Data Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
